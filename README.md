# Create Initial README.md for Payment Gateway

We need to create an initial README.md file to establish the first commit in the repository. This will allow the coding agent to work properly and create pull requests.

## Requirements:
- Create a comprehensive README.md file

This README will serve as the foundation for the payment gateway project and enable the coding agent to function properly for future pull requests.
